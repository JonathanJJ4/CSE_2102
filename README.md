Labs:
First, we start by cloning the local repositories 

to clone this repo in your terminal we put

git clone (https://github.com/JonathanJJ4/CSE_2102/tree/main/j2023_09_21/my-app)


after cloning we changed our current directory to the lab 

for example:

cd Cse2102/Lab0


after making sure we are in the right directory we compile and run the java code like so

compile: 
javac TestMe.java


run: 
java TestMe
